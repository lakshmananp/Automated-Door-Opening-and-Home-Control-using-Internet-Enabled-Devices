Objective : To automate the process of door opening by sending the best image of the person at the door out of a set of images captured when the person knocks the door/rings the bell to the house owners Android Mobile App . The Owner may either decide to open or close the door from his place by senidng a open/close command to the server via Wifi hosted which in turn directs the stepper motor interfaced witht the arduino board to rotate and open / close the door .
